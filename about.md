Born and raised in Tulsa, OK, I attended Edison Preparatory High School where I graduated as valedictorian in 2006. I have studied Physics for more than a decade now, and am working on my dissertation in theoretical plasma physics. I studied at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab as a long-term visting student from 2013 to 2016. My research work consists of developing analytic reduced models of energetic ion interactions with tearing mode instabilities in tokamaks, and finding the links between steady state settings and the driving or damping mechanism behind trapped ions.
