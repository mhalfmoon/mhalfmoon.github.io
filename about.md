Born and raised in Tulsa, OK, I attended Edison Preparatory High School where I graduated as valedictorian in 2006. I have studied Physics for more than a decade now, and am working on my dissertation. I studied at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab as a long-term visting student from 2013 to 2016. My research work consists of developing analytic reduced models of energetic ion interactions with tearing mode instabilities in tokamaks.
